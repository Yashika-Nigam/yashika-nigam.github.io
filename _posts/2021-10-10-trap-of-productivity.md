My Trello list for each year / quarter
Trello CSV added to _site -> assets -> files
- to track my yearly / quarterly goals
- to motivate me to acheive more, do more
- also creates ego & anxiety

My Reading Challenges on Goodreads
- read more than 5 books atleast anytime due to small attention span
- vanity metric to show off to the world how well read I am etc
- 70% books I read are good, rest 30% are graphic novels, novellas, short stories just to hit the milestone
- Submitted a request to extract my data from Goodreads on Oct-4

Github contribution heatmap
- makes me feel guilty about my lack of activity

All these activities are:
- self indulgent
- causes more anxiety
- creates more ego
- creates an image of yourself from which it can get very difficult to break apart


This productivity trap does mostly good, ends up creating some bad also
Small steps - 
- throw away past goals on Trello once they are done
- stop tracking books on Goodreads? don't think I can do that just as yet
how to go about dispassionate pursuit of passion ?
not reaching that state anytime soon, 
Until then, I'll have to continue on this ego trip and try and shed some of that baggage slowly as I go
