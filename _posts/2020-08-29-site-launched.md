## Hello World!

This is my (noob?) attempt at creating a personal website & blog. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), Github Pages and Markdown, which were surprisingly pretty simple to use. If you're interested to know how, check out this great [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) !!

Why this particular set of tools, you ask. Well I didn't want to put this content behind a paywall, like Medium, or keep it restricted to a single topic, like data science. I also didn't wanna use low code alternatives like Wordpress or Blogpsot, as I wanted more control over the site.
