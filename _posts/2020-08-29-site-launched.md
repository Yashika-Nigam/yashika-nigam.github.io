### Hello World!

This is my (noob?) attempt at creating a personal website & blog. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), Github Pages and Markdown, which were surprisingly pretty simple to use. If you're interested to know how, check out this great [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) !!
