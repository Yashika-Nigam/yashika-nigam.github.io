Read titles json - No such thing !!


My Reading Challenges on Goodreads
- read more than 5 books atleast anytime due to small attention span
- vanity metric to show off to the world how well read I am etc
- 70% books I read are good, rest 30% are graphic novels, novellas, short stories just to hit the milestone
- Submitted a request to extract my data from Goodreads on Oct-4
- Plot a box plot of activity counts by month and faceted by year
- Plot the start and end times of longest read books
- Shortest books are read mostly in the later months
- Ratio of quality of books vs quantity of books
