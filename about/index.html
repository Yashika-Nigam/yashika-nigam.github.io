<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>
I think of this blog as more of a journal about learnings related to my profession.
So I'll try to focus on technology, programming, data science, AI...
Though I might meander along some tangents every now & then.
</p>

<p>
I started blogging because I've heard a bunch of wise men, 
(<a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/">like him</a>),
say that blogging helps you learn better.
It's also what the cool kids are doing these days!
If this content is remotely interesting or useful to someone out there, 
then it's a win-win !!

This website is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> & Github Pages, 
which were surprisingly pretty simple to use. The theme is  
<a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker">Hacker</a> which is provided by Jekyll.
