<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>
I think of this blog as more of a journal about learnings related to my profession.
So I'll try to focus on technology, programming, data science, AI...
Though sometimes I might meander along some tangents.
I've heard a bunch of wise men, (<a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/">like him</a>),
say that blogging helps you learn better.
Plus, it's what the cool kids are doing these days. 
The hope is that if someone finds this content remotely interesting or useful, then it's a win-win !!

This website is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> & Github Pages, 
which were surprisingly pretty simple to use.
