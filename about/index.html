<h2>Hello World!</h2>

<p>
I think of this blog as more of a personal journal. It's not my first journal though!
</p>
<p>
I recently deleted 4000+ diary entries from my private online journal that
I had been maintaining since the last 6 years. Why you ask, maybe I'll answer that later.
</p>
<p>
I also have a physical diary which was gifted to me by my wife, 
and it's more about my day-to-day life!
</p>
<p>
This one, though, is more about technology, programming, data science, AI...
I've heard a bunch of wise men, (<a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/">like him</a>), say that blogging helps you learn better.
Plus, it's what the cool kids are doing these days. 
The hope is that if someone finds this content remotely interesting or useful, then it's a win-win !!

This website is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> & Github Pages, 
which were surprisingly pretty simple to use.

<!--
Why this particular set of tools, you ask. 
Well I didn't want to put this content behind a paywall, 
like Medium, or keep it restricted to a single topic, like data science. 
I also didn't wanna use low code alternatives like Wordpress or Blogpsot, 
as I wanted more control over the site.
